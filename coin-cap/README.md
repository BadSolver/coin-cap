This project is a graduate work at the front-end developer course, in which I tried to apply all the knowledge and skills I received

In that project:

- I've got a good practice in working with API
- I've learned how to work with different libraries such as Redux Toolkit, React Router, KY and many others

This is just a training project, but thanks to it, I learned in practice many of the intricacies of working with ReactJS.
